# Device ID Synchronization Issue Resolution

## Current Problem
We're experiencing "invalid device id format" errors in the macOS app during the connection process. This appears to be due to a mismatch between:
1. The iOS device's MCPeerID display name
2. The device ID sent in the HandshakeMessage response
3. The device name used in keep-alive messages

## Required Information
Please provide the following code sections from the iOS implementation:

1. MCPeerID Creation:
```swift
// Show how the MCPeerID is created, including the display name used
```

2. Handshake Response Creation:
```swift
// Show how the HandshakeMessage response is created, including:
// - type (should be .response)
// - deviceId
// - platform
```

3. Keep-Alive Message Creation:
```swift
// Show how keep-alive messages are created, including:
// - type
// - deviceId
// - timestamp
```

## Expected Format
The macOS app expects these values to be consistent:
1. MCPeerID.displayName should be: UIDevice.current.name
2. HandshakeMessage.deviceId should be: UIDevice.current.name
3. Keep-alive deviceId should be: UIDevice.current.name

## Current macOS Implementation
For reference, here's how the macOS app handles these values:

```swift
// When receiving handshake response:
let device = ConnectedDevice(
    id: peer.displayName,        // Uses peer's display name as ID
    name: peer.displayName,      // Uses peer's display name as name
    platform: "iOS",
    isAuthenticated: true
)

// When handling keep-alive:
if let deviceId = json["deviceId"] as? String {
    // Expects deviceId to match the peer's display name
}
```

## Required Changes
We need to ensure the iOS app:
1. Uses UIDevice.current.name consistently across all identification points
2. Sends the same device ID in both handshake and keep-alive messages
3. Uses this same value for the MCPeerID display name

## Verification Steps
Please provide logging output showing:
1. The MCPeerID display name when created
2. The complete HandshakeMessage when sending response
3. The complete keep-alive message content

This will help us verify that all device identifiers are synchronized and match the expected format.

## Example of Correct Implementation
```swift
// MCPeerID creation
let peerId = MCPeerID(displayName: UIDevice.current.name)

// Handshake response
let response = HandshakeMessage(
    type: .response,
    deviceId: UIDevice.current.name,  // Same as peerId.displayName
    platform: "iOS"
)

// Keep-alive message
let keepAlive: [String: Any] = [
    "type": "keep_alive",
    "timestamp": Date().timeIntervalSince1970,
    "deviceId": UIDevice.current.name  // Same as peerId.displayName
]
```
